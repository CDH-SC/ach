# Project Title

Always Coming Home: The American Female Veteran Experience Archive is designed to provide ongoing documentation of the diverse combat and service situations women in the military face as well as recording the experiences of the increasing numbers of female veterans whose return to civilian life has been affected by their years of service. Women veterans are interviewed, on video, and invited to share their reasons for joining the military, their experiences while in service, and the opportunities and setbacks they have faced upon return to civilian life. This project includes the short documentary “Soldier Girl.” There are currently over 50 interviews in the archive, some of which you can view here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
A system running docker, the rest of the dependancies will be loaded into the containers on initialization using docker-compose up

```
Give examples
```
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running
Say what the step will be

Once all of this has been complete,
instantiate the database by piping the the backup to the scalar_db file using
Tyler Moons [backup/restore](https://github.com/CDH-SC/ddbb) tool


```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
